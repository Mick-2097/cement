add object or building-
    How do I add a new object to the list if it is not stored locally?

non-props errors-
    These are the errors I couldn't fix earlier, I asked chat gpt why the errors occured and that's why I passed the props like I did.

Yesterday when I looked at swagger there was a way to add a building by giving parent_id only, today when I look it wants building object id aswell.
