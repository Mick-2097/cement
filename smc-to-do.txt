non-props errors-
    These are the errors I couldn't fix earlier, I asked chat gpt why the errors occured and that's why I passed the props like I did.

Yesterday when I looked at swagger there was a way to add a building by giving parent_id only, today when I look it wants building object id aswell.

4) Add create and edit button for building objects similar to what we have for buildings and implement the logic (check the old implementation) https://smc.dev.nlplay.ru/company/5/project/7/element/12/main (+button)
                                                                        implement crud function
                                                                        
5) Implement the tree
https://smc.dev.nlplay.ru/company/5/project/7/element/12/ (create and update)


6) For Area (Захватки в работе) use this page:
https://smc.dev.nlplay.ru/company/5/project/7/element/12/monitoring

Create page, make organization a dropdown
id, name
